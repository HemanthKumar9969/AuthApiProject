## User Authentication & Authorization API with JWT

## Project Overview

This project is a secure and scalable ASP.NET Core Web API that provides foundational user authentication and authorization for modern applications. It supports:

1: User registration with encrypted credentials (using BCrypt)

2: JWT-based login for stateless authentication

3: Access control to protected API endpoints via token validation

Built with Entity Framework Core and MS SQL Server, it ensures robust data persistence. The API follows security best practices with centralized configuration and integrates Swagger UI for interactive API documentation and easy testing.

## Key Features
üîê Secure User Registration: Implements a robust registration process that includes password hashing with unique salts (using BCrypt) to protect user credentials against common attack vectors like rainbow tables and brute-force attempts.

üîë JWT-Based Authentication: Provides a streamlined login mechanism where successful authentication results in the issuance of a short-lived JSON Web Token, used by clients to establish authenticated sessions without relying on server-side session state.

üõ°Ô∏è Endpoint Protection: Ensures that critical API endpoints are protected, verifying the authenticity and validity of every incoming JWT to restrict access solely to authorized users.

üë• Role-Based Authorization (RBAC): Enables granular control over API access by assigning specific roles (e.g., User, Admin) to users, allowing different endpoints or functionalities to be restricted based on the authenticated user's permissions.

üîí Password Security Best Practices: Leverages BCrypt's adaptive hashing to store passwords, making them computationally expensive to crack and highly resistant to offline attacks.

‚öôÔ∏è Centralized Configuration: Manages sensitive information, such as database connection strings and the JWT signing secret, securely through ASP.NET Core's configuration system, utilizing environment-specific files (appsettings.Development.json) to prevent credentials from being exposed in source control.

üìÑ Interactive API Documentation: Integrates Swagger UI to provide a live, interactive documentation portal for all API endpoints, significantly aiding developers in understanding, testing, and integrating with the API during development.
